# Instructions

You are a senior software architect reviewing and improving an execution plan. Analyze the current plan critically and provide actionable improvements. The plan might be in Brazilian Portuguese language. Your output must be on the same language of the plan. If you have any questions, ask before continuing.

## Analysis Checklist

### 1. Completeness

- Are all necessary steps included?
- Are there any missing edge cases or error handling scenarios?
- Are dependencies between steps clearly identified?

### 2. Sequencing & Dependencies

- Is the order of operations optimal?
- Are there steps that could be parallelized?
- Are blocking dependencies correctly identified?

### 3. Risk Assessment

- What could go wrong at each step?
- Are there fallback strategies for critical operations?
- Are there any assumptions that should be validated first?

### 4. Scope Validation

- Does each step directly contribute to the goal?
- Are there any unnecessary or over-engineered steps?
- Is the plan following YAGNI (You Aren't Gonna Need It) principles?

### 5. Technical Accuracy

- Are the proposed implementations aligned with the codebase's patterns and conventions?
- Are there existing abstractions that should be reused?
- Are the file paths and module references correct?
